# What is Bioinformatics?

Using informatics methods to connect biology (Genotypes) with Phenotypes

- Biology (not just genes!)
    - genomics
    - gene expression, 
    - immune system state
    - gut bacteria (microbiome)
- Phenotypes: A disease or trait of interest
    - Type 2 Diabetes
    - What are some others?

---

# What are these informatics methods?

Many, many techniques! 

- statistics 
- systems science
- machine learning
- systems biology
- visualization
- knowledge integration

---

# What else do you have to know?

- Basic Biology
    - Biological Regulation
- Basic Clinical Knowledge
- Limitations of the technology used
- Exciting (and stressful) because I learn new stuff everyday!
- Most important quality: Curiosity!

---

# Learning Objectives (hint)

+ What is a SNP variant?
+ How do we define a disease of interest?
+ What is a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS)?
    - How do we look for association?
+ Why are Odds Ratios important?

---
# Some Definitions before we start

+ Phenotype:
    - a condition we're interested in, such as disease
    - can also be a trait, such as height or BMI
    - varies across a population
+ Genotype:
    - the genetic/biological makeup of a subject we're interested in,
    - varies across a population
+ Treatment:
    - what we can do about this given phenotype and genotype
    - can be a drug or other kind of therapy (like chemotherapy)

# DNA Fun Facts

.pull-left[DNA information in encoded in 4 bases (A,C,G,T)

Each strand is made to read in a particular direction.

Our *coding strand* is paired with another one, called a *complementary strand*, which is read in the opposite direction and has the complementary base.

We'll only consider the *coding strand* for right now.

# What is a SNP?

.pull-left[A *SNP* (Single Nucelotide Polymorphism) is a single location in the genome where we observe *variation across a population*. We need three pieces of information to characterize a SNP: 

1. the chromosome it's on (chr 2)  
2. the linear position on the chromosome (3490525)  
3. the variant of interest (T)  

By definition, a *SNP* has to occur in at least 10% of the population being studied. This is in comparison to the base that is most frequently observed, which is called the *wild-type*.]

# We use a lot of SNPs in GWAS

Most GWAS use about 1 million of them!

Highly dispersed across the genome

---

# Parents and Genetics

Because we have two chromosomes (one from each parent), we will have two copies (values) at any SNP. Each of these copies is called an *allele*.

Knowing the value of both copies is my *genotype* for that SNP. 

For example, if my dad gave me a copy (allele) with an A, and my mom gave me a copy (allele) with a G, my genotype at that SNP location would be AG.

---

# A Simplification

.pull-left[Let's just consider whether we have one or more of our variant of interest in our genotype.

So, if we were interested in the T SNP variant where the *wild-type* is A, we'll look at those individuals that had at least one T (TT and AT) as one category, and the other where it's the wild-type, or what the majority of the population has (AA).]

.pull-right[
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; TT &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 10 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; AT &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 100 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; AA &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 300 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

# Phenotyping: Disease Identification

.pull-left[- May come from clinical diagnosis
    - Needs to be clearly defined
- Can be really difficult, especially in mental health
- The more clearly we define these differences, the more successful we are
    - Is there a quantitative cutoff?
    - For example: Obesity and Body Mass Index (BMI)]

# You need to find patients 

GWAS investigators need to find patients who are willing to participate in these studies.

Where do they come from?

- Clinician Referrals
- Study Coordinators
- Need to protect identity for privacy and ethical reasons

# Recruitment for a GWAS is Hard

# GWAS is a Test

GWAS is a test of whether genotype (SNP) is predictive of phenotype (disease)

Think of a SNP variant as being a diagnostic test.  

We want to quantify how good our test is. Much like in epidemiology, we will construct a 2x2 table to find associations of genotypes and phenotypes.
---
# 2x2 Tables for Genotype/Phenotype Association

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Disease+ &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Disease- &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; SNP+ &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 20 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 5 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; SNP- &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 4 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 100 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- Relate genetic variations (SNPs) to disease, one position at a time
    - **(SNP+/Disease+)**
    - (SNP+/Disease-)
    - (SNP-/Disease-)
    - **(SNP-/Disease-)**

# Statistical Testing for Association

Are the proportions of people who have the SNP in the case (Disease+) and control (Disease-) the same?

# A difference in proportions

Here is the 2x2 table and a proportional barplot, where we are looking at the difference between the proportions of SNP+ in the Disease+ versus Disease- cases.

Just looking at the barplot, do you think there is a difference in the proportions between Disease+ and Disease-?

# Which SNPs are important?

We scan each SNP, and conduct a statistical test of association to produce a p-value. 

We need to set a very small criteria of significance. 

Then we scan across the genome and find the really small p-values:

.footnote[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot#/media/File:Manhattan_Plot.png]

# Odds Ratio

Odds Ratio (OR): Very useful measure for assessing degree of association between disease and SNP variant.

Estimate of how different the proportions of SNP+ between Disease+ and Disease-

- OR &gt; 1: Disease/SNP association
      - This is what we're usually looking for in GWAS
      - If the OR is 2, my odds are 2:1 that I am (Disease+) compared to being (Disease-) if I have the variant (SNP+)
- OR = 1: There is no association between having the disease and the SNP variant
- OR &lt; 1: Having the SNP variant means you are less likely to have disease
      - Protective effect: also interesting

---

# We need to repeat our study

- Need to do a validation study in a separate population to confirm our associations. Why?

---

# Evidence to consider in a GWAS

- For your SNP, what is the odds ratio?
    - Rule of thumb: big OR is at least 2
- How big was the population used in your study?
- Who was the population used in your study?

# Discussion

1) How confident were you in your SNP variant?  
2) What evidence made you feel confident/less confident?  

---

# Our statistics needs to be better

- There are a lot of SNPs: over 3 million!
- Need to worry about false associations

---
# One Caveat

We may find a region associated with our disease, but it's not the same as knowing the mechanism.

We need to do further investigations of these regions to narrow the cause down.

# Single gene SNPs are not enough

- Systems biology: 
    - understanding how the interaction between genes leads to disease  
- Pathways: 
    - knowledge of how multiple genes interact  
- Polygenic Risk Scores (multiple genes and SNPs)
    - Use multiple SNPs as a test

---

# Open Questions

- How do we make GWAS more equitable to all?  
    - Ethical issues of privacy and equitability
- How do we make SNP information accessible and understandable?
- Need to make lots of information readily understandable
    - Clinicians
    - Consumers
- Need for transparent and open science!
