# Learning Objectives

- The problem: we are bad at standardizing the way we refer to things
- What is an Ontology?
    - And why should I care?
- What kinds of work do ontologies enable?
- How can ontologies enable novel work?

---
# How do we represent what we know?

- We don't always use the same words to refer to the same thing
    - Example: You might say: "pinky", "4th finger", "little finger"
- We don't always use the same word in same way
    - Example: "lead" can be an element or a word
- This is a problem
---
# Why is this important?

- If we want to know how many people at a hospital broke their pinky, that's a problem if everyone used different terms in their notes!
- If we want to identify lead levels in patients as opposed to patients who went to leadership conferences, that's a problem
- These examples are silly, but you get the point
---
# We need to represent what we know

- Representing what we know [concepts] 
- Representing how [concepts] are <related to each other>
- Example: 
    - [pinky finger]<is part of>[hand] 
    - [pinky finger]<is a synonym of>[little finger]

# Gene Ontologies: Bringing Meaning to Groups of Genes

- In analysis, we often identify sets of genes that are behaving differently in two or more conditions
- Gene sets can be large (50 or more), and just looking at the labels is confusing to biologists
- We use the Gene Ontologies to highlight commonalities and patterns of these gene sets
    - We have annotated genes with what we know
    
---
# Gene Ontology: Expression Modules

We can identify genes that behave similarly, but what do they have in common?
---
# Ontologies work best like Lego

- They are glue and Lego
- They are even better when linked together
- They can actually help link data together
    - Connecting disease phenotypes in mice to real diseases in humans
    - Given a disease, what genes should we study in mice?
---
# Ontologies enable serendipity

- Can lead us to novel hypotheses
- Can potentially connect people in diverse fields
- Avoid the "school of fish" versus "flock of birds" replication
---
# Ontologies are Hard 

- We can try to partially build them automatically
- They still require humans to confirm what's real and what's not
    - Curation (confirming relationships are real) is the hardest part
