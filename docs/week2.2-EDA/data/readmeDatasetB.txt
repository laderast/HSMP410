Data dictionary for Dataset B.

This data consists of 78 volunteer subjects tested at a local retirement community over a two month period. Patients were randomly assigned to have either a treatment or placebo. Since the study was double-blinded, neither the nurses who conducted the measurements nor the patients knew whether they received placebo or not.
