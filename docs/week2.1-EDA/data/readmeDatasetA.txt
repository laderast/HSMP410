Readme for Dataset A.

This data consists of volunteer subjects tested at a local university over a two month period. Patients were randomly assigned to have either a treatment (an experimental weight loss drug) or placebo. Since the study was double-blinded, neither the nurses who conducted the measurements nor the patients knew whether they received placebo or not.
